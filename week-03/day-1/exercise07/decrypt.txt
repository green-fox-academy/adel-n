Flat is better than nested.
by Tim Peters
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Now is better than never.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
The Zen of Python
Unless explicitly silenced.
Complex is better than complicated.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Simple is better than complex.
Errors should never pass silently.
Sparse is better than dense.
Explicit is better than implicit.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Readability counts.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
